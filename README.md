# Greppo_App
This repository contains code for the creation of a basic application using the greppo library, the environment was created and executed in ubuntu. The application was based on the use of products available in GEE (Google earth engine) for the extraction of altitude values and spectral indices in a coordinate. The use of greppo is a very good option to generate spatial data visualizations in a fast and manageable way for any user.
